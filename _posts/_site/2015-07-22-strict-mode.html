<h3 id="why-strict-modefrom-mdn">Why Strict mode(From MDN)</h3>

<p>Strict mode makes several changes to normal JavaScript semantics.</p>

<ul>
  <li>strict mode eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors. </li>
  <li>strict mode fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations: strict mode code can sometimes be made to run faster than identical code thatâ€™s not strict mode. </li>
  <li>strict mode prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="avoid-global-strict-mode">Avoid global strict mode</h3>

<p>When you concatenate javascript, global strict mode may cause some problems, it may apply to all the javascript files.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is thus recommended that you enable strict mode on a function-by-function basis (at least during the transition period).</p>
